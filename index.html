<H1>IFS Fractal Program</H1>

<P>This is a program to demonstrate the capabilities of IFS (Iterated Function
Series) using Affine maps. It plots, and outputs as a bitmap file, a rendition
of a 2D affine IFS fractal. </P>

<H2>Description</H2>

<P>A shape, an IFS fractal, is defined by a number of transforms. Each
one of these transforms map from the whole shape to a smaller self-similar
part of it. In an <I>affine</I> IFS fractal, each one of these transforms
is affine. </P>

<P>An affine transform is a linear transform with translation. Examples
of 2D affine transforms are rotation about an arbitrary point, reflection
in an arbitrary line, translation by any amount, etc.</P>

<P>So an affine IFS&nbsp;shape can be described by a set of transforms.
An implementation generally has probabilities associated with these.</P>

<H2>Implementation</H2>

<P>Handily, the PC shareware program 'fractint' includes a file which
defines several affine IFS images. This is parsed. Each shape is defined
over a number of lines, each line contains the description of the transform
and its associated probability.</P>

<P>The program performs the following steps: </P>

<OL>
<LI>Parse command line (run without parameters to see options) </LI>
<LI>Parse fractint's IFS file (included) to find this image </LI>
<LI>Generate the image (see later)</LI>
<LI>Write the image to a BMP file </LI>
</OL>

<H2>Algorithm</H2>

<P>Given a point on the object, the point transformed by any of the transforms
will also be on the object. The algorithm works by this method. Given a
point on the object, a transform is chosen according to the probabilities
attached to them and the point is transformed. The new point is then marked
as having been visited. The process is repeated until some bound on the
number of points to be plotted has been reached. The initial point is chosen
at random: after a few transforms the point will lie on the object. Hence
the first couple of points found are not plotted.</P>

<H2>Sample images</H2>

<P>There are plenty of images in the archives under the section 'the program'.
More can easily be generated by the program either from the supplied IFS&nbsp;description
file, or by extending the file.</P>

<P>However, two are reproduced here for ease of downloading:</P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="fern.html">The famous fractal fern</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="dragon.html">The dragon tree</A></LI>
</UL>

<H2>The program</H2>

<P>There are two forms of the program here: </P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="ifs.tar.gz">In UNIX .tar.gz format</A> </LI>

<LI><A HREF="ifs.zip">In DOS .zip format</A> </LI>
</UL>

<P>The files unpack to </P>

<UL>
<LI><I>A set of .bmp images.</I> These are output from the program.</LI>

<LI><I>A UNIX script called 'calcall'.</I> This generates each image under
a certain parameter set (see the file more more details) </LI>

<LI><I>The files 'bitmap.c' and 'bitmap.h'.</I> These are BMP writing code,
written by Robin Salih. </LI>

<LI><I>The file 'ifs.c'.</I> This is the file concerned with the IFS image
generation. This was written by me, Adrian Smith.
</UL>

The files 'bitmap.c' and 'ifs.c' should be compiled together using an ANSI
C compiler.  Run the resulting executable with no parameters to receive
information on options.
